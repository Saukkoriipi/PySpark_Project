# PySpark_Project

#### The given project questions were:

1. For the first data set (data-1.txt), provide the value of the median of the data set. You should provide the exact median, not an approximation, and sorting the complete data set is not an acceptable solution.

2. The second data set (data-2.txt) contains the matrix A. Your task is to calculate A ∗ A􏰀 ∗ A and provide the resulting matrix as your answer in the same format as the input matrix
